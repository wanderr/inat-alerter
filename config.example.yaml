# iNaturalist Alerter Configuration
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize for your needs

# IANA timezone for all date/time displays in emails
# Examples: America/New_York, Europe/London, Asia/Taipei
timezone: "Asia/Taipei"

# Geographic scope
location:
  # Center point for observation radius
  lat: 25.0330
  lng: 121.5654
  # Radius in kilometers
  radius: 50

# Taxa to monitor
# Specify taxon_ids to include (descendants are automatically included)
# Use https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/search to find taxon IDs
taxa:
  # List of taxon IDs to monitor
  # Example: [26036] for snakes, [47178] for birds, [47126] for flowering plants
  include:
    - 26036
  
  # Optional: taxon IDs to explicitly exclude (useful to filter out descendants)
  # Example: exclude a common species from an otherwise interesting genus
  exclude: []

# Watchlist for hourly alerts
# These can be completely independent from the main taxa list
watchlist:
  # Taxon IDs that trigger immediate alerts
  # Leave empty to disable alerts
  taxa_ids: []

# Rarity calculation method for sorting digest observations
rarity:
  # Method: "radius" (within configured radius), "place" (within iNat place), or "global"
  method: "radius"
  
  # Optional: iNaturalist place ID (only used if method is "place")
  # Find place IDs at https://www.inaturalist.org/places
  # Example: 7887 for Taiwan
  place_id: null

# Define when observations are considered "old"
# Old observations appear in digest but grouped separately
# Old observations do NOT trigger alerts
old_observation:
  # Number of days - observations older than this are considered "old"
  days_old_threshold: 30

# Weekly digest schedule
digest:
  enabled: true
  # Day of week: 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ..., 6 = Saturday
  day_of_week: 0
  # Hour in 24-hour format (local time based on timezone above)
  local_hour: 8

# Hourly alerts
alerts:
  enabled: true

# State management
state:
  # How long to retain state artifacts in GitHub Actions (days)
  artifact_retention_days: 14

# Email configuration (do NOT put credentials here - use GitHub Secrets)
# Supported secrets (set in GitHub repository settings):
#   SMTP_HOST - SMTP server hostname
#   SMTP_PORT - SMTP server port (usually 587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
#   SMTP_USERNAME - SMTP username
#   SMTP_PASSWORD - SMTP password
#   SMTP_FROM_EMAIL - Sender email address
#   SMTP_FROM_NAME - Sender display name (optional)
#   EMAIL_RECIPIENTS - Comma-separated list of recipient email addresses
